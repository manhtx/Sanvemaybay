The executor is strictly bound to the locked technical solutions detailed in Section D & E.
The executor is FORBIDDEN from inventing new architectures, introducing alternative algorithms,
changing database schemas, or deviating from the specified file/function diffs.
Any deviation is a critical contract breach and will be rejected closed by the Evidence Admission Controller.

## SECTION D: LOCKED ARCHITECTURAL SOLUTIONS (CYCLE G72 BASELINE)

### SOL-01: SOL-DATA-01 (Null Preservation & Sample Size Threshold $N \ge 5$)
- **Target File**: `src/app/data/api.ts` & `src/domain/farely/priceAnomaly.ts`
- **Specification**: Helper `parseNullableNumber(val)` preserves `null` and `undefined` without coercion to 0. In `priceAnomaly.ts`, require both sample variance $\sigma > 0.05 \mu$ AND sample size $N \ge 5$ before calculating z-scores. Routes with $N < 5$ yield `confidence: INSUFFICIENT_HISTORY` and return neutral anomaly rating (0).
- **Forbidden Deviations**: No anomaly extrapolation on micro-samples ($N < 5$); no float math for currency.
- **Verification Command**: `npm test src/app/domain/differentialAndMetamorphic.test.ts`

### SOL-02: SOL-PRICE-01 (Deterministic Tet Window Lookup & Seasonal Multiplier)
- **Target File**: `src/domain/farely/priceAnomaly.ts`
- **Specification**: Domestic trunk routes (HAN <-> SGN, DAD <-> SGN) during peak Tet lunar windows apply a deterministic $2.8\times$ baseline multiplier to prevent false anomaly triggers. Date evaluation is locked to ICT (UTC+7).
- **Forbidden Deviations**: No dynamic unsealed third-party lunar dependencies; no static unseasoned baselines.
- **Verification Command**: `node scripts/price-truth-harness.node-test.mjs`

### SOL-03: SOL-COST-01 (Sealed Carrier Landed Surcharges & Self-Transfer Risk)
- **Target File**: `src/domain/farely/tripBudgetEstimator.ts` & `src/domain/farely/multiCityItinerary.ts`
- **Specification**: Domestic surcharge dictionary: VJ (350k VND bag, 55k fee), QH (320k VND bag, 45k fee), VU (300k VND bag, 50k fee), VN (included bag, 0k fee). Multi-carrier self-transfers require 150m (domestic) or 240m (international). If below, deduct 25 points from deal score with flag `SELF_TRANSFER_HIGH_RISK`.
- **Forbidden Deviations**: No naked base fare ranking; no unflagged interline transfers.
- **Verification Command**: `npm test src/domain/farely/multiCityItinerary.test.ts`

### SOL-04: SOL-AUTH-01 (Rate-Limited Tokenized Watch Outbox & Row-Level Locking)
- **Target File**: `supabase/migrations/20261005010000_release_convergence_and_snapshot_atomicity.sql`
- **Specification**: Enforces IP and email throttling at database level (max 5 alerts/hour) via `check_watch_rate_limit()`. Outbox batch evaluation utilizes `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` to prevent concurrent queue deadlocks.
- **Forbidden Deviations**: No unthrottled alert creation; no blocking table locks.
- **Verification Command**: `node scripts/watch-outbox-atomicity.node-test.mjs`

### SOL-05: SOL-CIRCUIT-01 (Postgres-Synced Circuit Breaker with Retry-After)
- **Target File**: `supabase/functions/_shared/flight-search.ts`
- **Specification**: Circuit breaker coordinates across serverless instances via `operational_scan_health`. On HTTP 429, parses `Retry-After` header and writes cool-off expiry to database. All external fetches enforce `AbortSignal.timeout(8000)`.
- **Forbidden Deviations**: No uncoordinated in-memory circuit breakers; no un-timeouted fetches.
- **Verification Command**: `node scripts/provider-drift-and-killswitch.node-test.mjs`

### SOL-06: SOL-STALE-01 (Triple Visual Badges & 14-Day IndexedDB Eviction)
- **Target File**: `src/app/pages/DealsPage.tsx` & `src/domain/farely/pwaOfflineFreshness.ts`
- **Specification**: Renders `FRESH` (<120m), `WARM` (120m–360m), and `STALE` (>360m) with accessibility aria-labels. Enforces local storage quota by evicting cached search observations older than 14 days upon app mount.
- **Forbidden Deviations**: No hiding stale warnings; no unbounded offline cache accumulation.
- **Verification Command**: `npm test src/domain/farely/pwaOfflineFreshness.test.ts`

### SOL-07: SOL-TELEMETRY-01 (Modular UI Architecture & Circular-Safe Telemetry)
- **Target File**: `src/app/lib/analytics.ts` & `src/app/data/api.ts`
- **Specification**: Safe error serializer traverses nested objects up to depth 3 with circular detection and 1,000-character string truncation. Enforces mobile bundle budget under 250KB gzipped by decoupling large type definitions from rendering components.
- **Forbidden Deviations**: No unhandled `JSON.stringify` exceptions; no bundle inflation >250KB.
- **Verification Command**: `node scripts/client-error-boundary.node-test.mjs`

### SOL-08: SOL-MIGRATION-01 (Composite B-Tree Indexes & 47-Migration Parity)
- **Target File**: `supabase/migrations/`
- **Specification**: Exactly 47 canonical migrations verified. All search observation queries covered by composite index `(origin_iata, destination_iata, observed_at DESC)` to eliminate table scans.
- **Forbidden Deviations**: No sequential full-table scans on search queries; no unversioned DDL.
- **Verification Command**: `node scripts/migration-parity.node-test.mjs`

### SOL-09: SOL-PROOF-01 (C0..C4 Proof Hierarchy & Anti-Self-Certification)
- **Target File**: `scripts/verify-certification-integrity.node-test.mjs`
- **Specification**: Explicitly enforces `TARGET_PROVEN: FALSE`, `PRODUCT_ACCEPTANCE: NOT_ESTABLISHED`. Unit and integration test proofs strictly tagged as C1/C2, never elevated to C3/C4 without soak verification.
- **Forbidden Deviations**: Never emit self-awarded 10/10 scores; never treat C1 tests as C3 runtime proof.
- **Verification Command**: `node scripts/verify-certification-integrity.node-test.mjs`

### SOL-10: SOL-SHRINK-01 (267 Historical Gates & 32 P2 Semantic Preservation)
- **Target File**: `scripts/acceptance-anti-shrinkage.node-test.mjs`
- **Specification**: Asserts 192 P0, 74 P1, and 1 P2 gates with authentic test assertions.
- **Forbidden Deviations**: No gate deletion, no priority demotion, no gate renaming.
- **Verification Command**: `node scripts/acceptance-anti-shrinkage.node-test.mjs`

### SOL-11: SOL-TURNKEY-01 (Cryptographic Snapshotting & Orphan-Clean Rollback)
- **Target File**: `scripts/convergence/transactional-task-manager.mjs`
- **Specification**: Pre-task SHA-256 file hashing guarantees byte-for-byte rollback integrity. Rollback deletes newly created orphan files and releases PID write lock.
- **Forbidden Deviations**: No untracked file residue after task rollback.
- **Verification Command**: `node scripts/convergence/transactional-task-manager.mjs status`

### SOL-12: SOL-RELEASE-01 (Git Remote Fast-Forward & SHA Parity)
- **Target File**: `scripts/convergence/watchdog-convergence.mjs`
- **Specification**: Enforces remote SHA equality with `origin/antigravity/farely-v12-product-convergence` with 0 ahead, 0 behind, and zero untracked working-tree artifacts.
- **Forbidden Deviations**: No completion declaration with unpushed commits or untracked changes.
- **Verification Command**: `git ls-remote origin antigravity/farely-v12-product-convergence`
