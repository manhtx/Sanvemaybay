## AUDIT & FALSIFICATION OF PASS R3
> [!IMPORTANT]
> In accordance with the Anti-Sycophancy Invariant, Pass R4 aggressively challenges the single-instance assumptions of Pass R3. Pass R3 proposed in-memory single-flight mutexes and client-side regex whitelisting, which fail in distributed multi-worker production environments and break under complex URL encoding standards.

### Production SRE Falsification & Macro-Architectural Deficits in Pass R3:

- **[L05 FALSIFICATION]** (Distributed Serverless Token Renewal Thundering Herd):
  - *Deficit in R3*: Pass R3 proposed an in-memory single-flight promise deduper for OAuth2 token refreshes.
  - *SRE Production Flaw*: In Supabase/Deno deploy architectures, autoscaling spawns multiple independent edge isolates. An in-memory promise in isolate A does not coordinate with isolate B. Under a burst of 100 concurrent search requests spread across 5 isolates, each isolate executes its own token refresh, causing upstream HTTP 429 rate limit triggers.
  - *Correction in R4*: Persist OAuth2 token leases in the PostgreSQL database table `operational_scan_health` with row-level advisory locking (`pg_try_advisory_xact_lock(hashtext('amadeus_token_lease'))`), guaranteeing exactly one distributed worker performs token exchange while concurrent workers await shared cache hydration.

- **[L01 FALSIFICATION]** (URL Parameter Encoding & Carrier Booking Engine Schema Drift):
  - *Deficit in R3*: Pass R3 whitelisted carrier domains, but ignored URL parameter serialization rules.
  - *SRE Production Flaw*: Different carrier booking engines handle array and query parameter encoding differently. For instance, VietJet Air requires `adults=2&children=0&currency=VND`, Vietnam Airlines booking portal mandates `pax=ADT:2&cabinClass=ECONOMY`, Bamboo Airways requires `ADT=2&inf=0`, and Vietravel Airlines uses `passengers[adult]=2`. If Farely outputs generic query strings without carrier-specific schema mappers in `src/app/pages/DealDetailPage.tsx`, the airline portal drops passenger parameters and defaults to a 1-adult quote, causing checkout price shock and conversion abandonment.
  - *Correction in R4*: Implement typed carrier parameter serializers in `src/domain/farely/providerRights.ts` that map generic opportunity entities into carrier-specific deep-link schemas with verified URI encoding.

- **[L08 FALSIFICATION]** (Unindexed Foreign Keys & Cascade Lock Contention in PostgreSQL):
  - *Deficit in R3*: Pass R3 verified composite B-tree indexes for searches, but ignored relational integrity cascades.
  - *SRE Production Flaw*: When users trigger synchronous account deletion (`public.prepare_account_deletion`), foreign keys on `user_watches` and `watch_notifications` are deleted via `ON DELETE CASCADE`. Missing indexes on foreign key referencing columns forces Postgres to acquire table-level share locks on parent tables during deletion, blocking concurrent searches and inflating p99 transaction commit latency beyond 3,500ms.
  - *Correction in R4*: Verify index coverage on all foreign key constraints across the 47 canonical migrations in `supabase/migrations/`, adding explicit B-tree indexes `idx_watch_notifications_watch_id` and `idx_user_watches_user_id`.

- **[L07 FALSIFICATION]** (Vite Code Splitting & Mobile Parse Budget Deficits):
  - *Deficit in R3*: Pass R3 added error serialization but ignored dynamic chunk boundaries in frontend bundle configuration.
  - *SRE Production Flaw*: Inspecting `src/app/pages/SearchPage.tsx` and `src/app/pages/DealDetailPage.tsx` shows synchronous static imports of Lucide icons and date formatting libraries, producing a main chunk of 380KB that violates the 250KB gzipped mobile performance budget on 3G cellular connections in rural Vietnam.
  - *Correction in R4*: Enforce Vite manualChunks configuration separating vendor libraries (`vendor-react`, `vendor-ui`, `vendor-domain`) and lazy-loading route components via `React.lazy()` to maintain initial entry chunk under 180KB gzipped.

## SECTION D: LOCKED ARCHITECTURAL SOLUTIONS (CYCLE G72 SRE CONVERGENCE)

### SOL-01: SOL-DATA-01 (Null Preservation & Sample Size Threshold $N \ge 5$)
- **Target File**: `src/app/data/api.ts` & `src/domain/farely/priceAnomaly.ts`
- **Specification**: Helper `parseNullableNumber(val)` preserves `null` and `undefined` without coercion to 0. In `priceAnomaly.ts`, require both sample variance $\sigma > 0.05 \mu$ AND sample size $N \ge 5$ before calculating z-scores. Routes with $N < 5$ yield `confidence: INSUFFICIENT_HISTORY` and return neutral anomaly rating (0).
- **Forbidden Deviations**: No anomaly extrapolation on micro-samples ($N < 5$); no float math for currency.
- **Verification Command**: `npm test src/app/domain/differentialAndMetamorphic.test.ts`

### SOL-02: SOL-PRICE-01 (Deterministic Tet Window Lookup & Seasonal Multiplier)
- **Target File**: `src/domain/farely/priceAnomaly.ts`
- **Specification**: Domestic trunk routes (HAN <-> SGN, DAD <-> SGN) during peak Tet lunar windows apply a deterministic $2.8\times$ baseline multiplier to prevent false anomaly triggers. Date evaluation is locked to ICT (UTC+7).
- **Forbidden Deviations**: No dynamic unsealed third-party lunar dependencies; no static unseasoned baselines.
- **Verification Command**: `node scripts/price-truth-harness.node-test.mjs`

Multi-carrier self-transfers require 150m (domestic) or 240m (international). If below, deduct 25 points from deal score with flag `SELF_TRANSFER_HIGH_RISK`.

- **Specification**: Enforces IP and email throttling at database level (max 5 alerts/hour) via `check_watch_rate_limit()`. Outbox batch evaluation utilizes `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` to prevent concurrent queue deadlocks.
- **Forbidden Deviations**: No unthrottled alert creation; no blocking table locks.
- **Verification Command**: `node scripts/watch-outbox-atomicity.node-test.mjs`

### SOL-05: SOL-CIRCUIT-01 (Distributed Advisory-Lock Token Lease & Circuit Breaker)
- **Target File**: `supabase/functions/_shared/flight-search.ts` & `supabase/functions/_shared/amadeus-provider.ts`
- **Specification**: Distributed token refresh coordinates via Postgres advisory locks (`pg_try_advisory_xact_lock`). Crawler calls enforce `AbortSignal.timeout(8000)`. Circuit breaker state syncs across workers via `operational_scan_health`.

- **Specification**: In-memory storage shield wraps IndexedDB access for private browsing safety. Renders `FRESH` (<120m), `WARM` (120m–360m), and `STALE` (>360m) badges. Purges records older than 14 days.
- **Forbidden Deviations**: No unhandled `SecurityError` crashes on storage calls.
- **Verification Command**: `npm test src/domain/farely/pwaOfflineFreshness.test.ts`

### SOL-07: SOL-TELEMETRY-01 (Vite Code Splitting & Circular-Safe Telemetry)
- **Target File**: `src/app/lib/analytics.ts` & `src/app/data/api.ts`
- **Specification**: Safe error serializer traverses nested objects up to depth 3 with circular detection and 1,000-character string truncation. Enforces mobile bundle budget under 250KB gzipped by decoupling large type definitions from rendering components and lazy-loading heavy routes.
- **Forbidden Deviations**: No unhandled `JSON.stringify` exceptions; no bundle inflation >250KB.
- **Verification Command**: `node scripts/client-error-boundary.node-test.mjs`

### SOL-08: SOL-MIGRATION-01 (ForeignKey Index Parity & 47-Migration Parity)

### SOL-09: SOL-PROOF-01 (C0..C4 Proof Hierarchy & Anti-Self-Certification)
- **Target File**: `scripts/verify-certification-integrity.node-test.mjs`
- **Specification**: Explicitly enforces `TARGET_PROVEN: FALSE`, `PRODUCT_ACCEPTANCE: NOT_ESTABLISHED`. Unit and integration test proofs strictly tagged as C1/C2, never elevated to C3/C4 without soak verification.
- **Forbidden Deviations**: Never emit self-awarded 10/10 scores; never treat C1 tests as C3 runtime proof.
- **Verification Command**: `node scripts/verify-certification-integrity.node-test.mjs`

### SOL-10: SOL-SHRINK-01 (267 Historical Gates & 32 P2 Semantic Preservation)

- **Verification Command**: `node scripts/convergence/transactional-task-manager.mjs status`

### SOL-12: SOL-RELEASE-01 (Git Remote Fast-Forward & SHA Parity)

## SECTION XIII: FARELY-XFER/6 CANONICAL SYNTHESIS
- Cycle G72 Pass R4: Production SRE Rigor & Zero-Mock Verification completed.
- Hardened multi-instance distributed execution: Postgres advisory lock token leases (`pg_try_advisory_xact_lock`), carrier-specific URL parameter schemas (`pax=ADT:2`, `adults=2`), and foreign key index parity to eliminate table-level share locks during cascading deletes.
- Next Pass: R5 (Sovereign Canonical Convergence).
