## AUDIT & FALSIFICATION OF PASS G2
> [!IMPORTANT]
> To eliminate sycophancy and shallow acceptance, this section actively critiques Pass G2 across all 12 lenses.

### Falsified Assumptions & Discovered Deficits in Pass G2:
- **[L01 FALSIFICATION]** (Product Truth & Founder Scope Integrity):
  - *Deficit in G2*: Assumed URL parser cannot be tricked by username/password prefixes (`http://google.com@evil.com`).
  - *Correction in G3*: Audited `src/domain/farely/providerRights.ts`. Strictly validates parsed URL hostname property, rejecting embedded auth credentials.
- **[L02 FALSIFICATION]** (Price, Historical Baseline & Data Integrity):
  - *Deficit in G2*: Did not test negative numeric inputs like `"-500000"`.
  - *Correction in G3*: Verified `parseNullableNumber()` in `src/app/data/api.ts` enforces `val > 0`, returning `null` on negative numbers.
- **[L03 FALSIFICATION]** (Deal Score, Statistical Confidence & Cost Monotonicity):
  - *Deficit in G2*: Did not test division by zero when standard deviation is exactly 0.
  - *Correction in G3*: Audited `src/domain/farely/priceAnomaly.ts`. Falls back to percentage threshold if standard deviation is zero.
- **[L04 FALSIFICATION]** (Auth, Privacy, Tenant Isolation & RLS Matrix):
  - *Deficit in G2*: Did not test race condition where user deletes account while an alert is being evaluated.
  - *Correction in G3*: Stored procedure `prepare_account_deletion` acquires row exclusive locks, cancelling pending alert evaluations.
- **[L05 FALSIFICATION]** (Provider Drift, Circuit Breakers & Kill Switches):
  - *Deficit in G2*: Did not test jitter entropy on concurrent request retries.
  - *Correction in G3*: Verified full-jitter formula `Math.random() * Math.min(maxBackoff, base * 2 ** attempt)` in `supabase/functions/_shared/flight-search.ts`.
- **[L06 FALSIFICATION]** (Freshness, Stale Degradation & UX Honesty):
  - *Deficit in G2*: Did not test stale badge contrast ratio for accessibility.
  - *Correction in G3*: Enforces WCAG AA compliant colors (contrast ratio >= 4.5:1) in `src/app/pages/DealsPage.tsx`.
- **[L07 FALSIFICATION]** (Observability, Secret Scrubbing & Error Boundaries):
  - *Deficit in G2*: Did not test scrubbing on circular object references.
  - *Correction in G3*: Audited `src/app/lib/sharing.ts`. Uses `WeakSet` memoization to prevent call stack overflow during recursive telemetry serialization.
- **[L08 FALSIFICATION]** (Database Architecture, Schema Drift & Migration Provenance):
  - *Deficit in G2*: Did not test deadlock on foreign key index recreation.
  - *Correction in G3*: Verified `CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY` directives in `supabase/migrations/`.
- **[L09 FALSIFICATION]** (Proof Hierarchy & Anti-Self-Certification (C0..C4)):
  - *Deficit in G2*: Did not test test-runner environment tampering.
  - *Correction in G3*: Audited `scripts/verify-certification-integrity.node-test.mjs`. Asserts git tree hash integrity before executing suite.
- **[L10 FALSIFICATION]** (Anti-Shrinkage & 267 Historical Gates Traceability):
  - *Deficit in G2*: Did not test gate omission via comment blocks.
  - *Correction in G3*: AST parser in `scripts/acceptance-anti-shrinkage.node-test.mjs` verifies actual function execution rather than textual regex matching.
- **[L11 FALSIFICATION]** (Turnkey Execution, Topological DAG & Rollback Runbooks):
  - *Deficit in G2*: Did not test rollback when target file was newly created during task.
  - *Correction in G3*: Verified `scripts/convergence/transactional-task-manager.mjs` deletes newly created files when rolling back snapshot.
- **[L12 FALSIFICATION]** (Zero-Trust Release & Remote Git Synchronization):
  - *Deficit in G2*: Did not verify remote tracking upstream configuration.
  - *Correction in G3*: Verified `git rev-parse --abbrev-ref @{u}` assertion in `scripts/convergence/watchdog-convergence.mjs`.
